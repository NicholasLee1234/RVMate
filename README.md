# RVMate
This is our submission to the "Everyday Science Hackathon" by HKU. We have developed an app called RVMate to incentivise users to recycle more through gamification. 

In more detail, the goal of the game is to collect stickers (which are inspired by various HK cartoons), similar to other popular games such as Pokemon Go and Pikmin Bloom. For every bottle the user recycles, they get to open a sticker pack, further encouraging them to use these machines. Additionally, the users would be able to see their personal statistics, such as their bottle recycling trends and the types of bottles recycled. 

However, the function of the app is much more than that. These users statistics are sent to a government server, in which they can see global HK trends in bottle recycling. The goal is for them to be able to produce better regulations and subsidies to make users more engaged with recycling.
